# WeatherWizard
# Developed by Skardsen3 on 14/11/2021 as a test fo OpenWeatherAPI



#Uses openweatherapi to find the current temp for Wellington and Christchurch (Or 2 specified places).
#Could be expanded to include things like better weather, daily highs etc.
#For some reason when I do non-NZ places like Rome it returns 0.X degrees
